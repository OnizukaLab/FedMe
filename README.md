# FedMe: Federated Learning via Model Exchange

This is the code accompanying the CIKM 2021 paper "FedMe: Federated Learning via Model Exchange" 

# Dataset

We have three datasets, FEMNIST, CIFAR-10, and Shakespeare, which you should download from 'data' when running with FEMNIST and Shakespeare.

# Code

We have prepared nine Jupiter notebook-style codes for the three datasets: 'Centralized', 'Local Data Only', 'FedAvg', 'HypCluster', 'MAAPER', 'Federated Mutual Learning', 'pFedMe', and 'FedMe'.
'FEMNIST', 'CIFAR-10', and 'Shakespeare' contain the respective codes.
Note that the hyperparameters in these codes are not tuned, so please change the value of each and run them.
